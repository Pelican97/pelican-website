        I have a baby her name is Yamkelani,she is 8 years old.I got pregnant at the very young age of 14 years but i didn't know i was carrying a baby that time but it happened for me to be a teenage mother.
        I did regret my self that time because i dissapointed my family aspecially my mother.but nothing last forever that pain of having a child at the young age was very painful but i raised my child with love&caring now she's old and im proud of my baby.she's my life i love her very much.
